File retrieval utilities

wget and curl are commonly used utilities for retrieving files from other servers.

wget:
• Can do a recursive download
• Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols
• Performs retries over an unreliable connection 

curl
• Downloads a single resource only 
• Supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and many other additional protocols (for example: FTPS and FILE)
• Runs on more platforms than wget

Two popular utilities—wget and curl—are commonly used to download files to a server.
Both support the HTTP, HTTPS, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) protocols and provide additional capabilities of their own.
Note the following:

• With wget, you can download a single resource or multiple resources recursively that reside under a given Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
It also automatically tries to resume a download if the network connection is broken.

• curl can download only a single resource at a time, but it supports more protocols and runs on more platforms than wget.
For example, curl supports the FILE protocol, which you can use to retrieve a file from the local file system.

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
The -o option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to (in this case, awscliv2.zip).
