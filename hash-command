The hash command can be used to view recently run programs, their location in the file system, and the number of times they were run.
Specifically, the hash command displays or modifies the remembered location of the program associated with a given command and how many times the command was run.
It stores this information in a hash table and provides options to display, reset, or delete the table’s content.
A program’s location information consists of its full path name in the file system.

Syntax: hash [-lr] [-p pathName] [-dt] [commandName ...]

Some command options are as follows. 
-d: Deletes the location for commandName from the hash table 
-l: Displays output in a format that can be used as input to another command
-p: Sets pathName as the the full path location for commandName
-r: Empties the hash table
-t: Displays the location of commandName
