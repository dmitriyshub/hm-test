The tar command:
----------------

Bundles a collection of files into a single archive file for easier copying or downloading
Created bundle is called a tarball
Contents of an archive file can optionally be compressed
The command is also used to unbundle an archive file

For example:
– To bundle and compress file1, file2, and file3 into a file called tarball.tar:
tar -cvf tarball.tar file1 file2 file3
– To unbundle or extract files from the tarball:
tar -xf tarball.tar

The tar command is used for the following:
File downloads
Large numbers of files to copy or move
Internet downloads, including software

-x Extracts the contents of a tarball
-z Compresses the contents of a tarball by using the gzip utility
-f Specifies the name of the tarball
-v Produces verbose output by showing file names while the tarball is processed 

Some tar options are mandatory when extracting.
-x: Extracts a tarball (an archive file)
-z: Uses gzip (see later in this lesson)
-f: Provides the name of the tarball
-v: Shows the progress as the tarball is created

-----------------
The gzip command:
-----------------

Use the gzip command to compress or decompress files, including tarballs:
Common with internet downloads
Common with archiving log files
Common with archiving old data

Files can be both tarred and gzipped, and files that are created with the gzip command will have the .gz extension.

Compresses or decompresses files, including tarballs
Examples:
– To compress a tarball: gzip salesdata.tar
– To decompress a tarball: gzip -d salesdata.tar.gz
