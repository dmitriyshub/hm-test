Managing services with the systemctl command:

• The following is the syntax of the systemctl command: systemctl <subcommand> <service name>
• The following are common troubleshooting tasks if services aren't working correctly: • Restart after any configuration change. • Restart when troubleshooting.
• The systemctl command has many subcommands, including status, start, stop, restart, enable, and disable.
• Services provide functionality such as networking, remote administration, and security. 

After installing httpd (yum install httpd),
the sudo systemctl status httpd command shows you that the service is not started or activated (to start the system at boot time).
The sudo systemctl start httpd command starts the service.
The sudo systemctl enable httpd command activates the service so that it is available after restarting the machine.

Using the systemctl command, perform the following actions:
1. Show the running services.
2. List all services whether the service is active, exited, or failed.
3. List all active services.
