Log rotation
• Servers typically run large applications. o Servers often log every request. 
o This logging leads to bulky log files.
• Log rotation can help with the following in regard to bulky logs:
o It is a way to limit the total size of the logs that are retained.
o It still helps analysis of recent events.
• Log rotation is an automated process that is used in system administration where dated log files are archived.

Log rotation is not activated by default.
With the logrotate utility, you can compress, rename, or clean up the log files.
You can activate log rotation according to the log file size: if the log file is more than a specific size, it will be renamed xxxxx.log-20210612
(if it is renamed on June 21, 2021).
The default date format is yyyymmdd.
It can also be activated on a regular basis (weekly, daily or monthly).
A maximum number of log files to keep can be set: if the maximum number of logs is reached, the logs are erased, moved, or emailed.
You can also compress log files.
You can individually tailor log rotation for different kinds of logs.
