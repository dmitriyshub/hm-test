The following are examples:
• cat yourlog.log | grep ERROR 
• tail -f yourlog.log | grep error 
• sudo cat /tmp/log/secure | grep LOGIN > SharedFolders/logins.csv

The following are some more details on these errors.
•cat yourlog.log | grep ERROR: searches for the ERROR message in the yourlog.log file and displays the matching lines of the file in the console 
(reads the content of the yourlog.log file and redirects it to the grep command that searches for the word ERROR).

•tail -f yourlog.log | grep error: searches the word error in the last 10 lines of the yourlog.log file and displays the matching lines of the file in the console 
(reads the last 10 lines of the yourlog.log file and redirects it to the grep command that searches for the word error;remember that without any additional option, tail reads the last 10 lines of a file).

•sudo cat /var/log/secure | grep LOGIN > SharedFolders/logins.csv: searches the word LOGIN in the file /var/log/secure and writes the matching lines of the file in the file SharedFolders/logins.csv. Sudo is required to access the /var/log/secure file.
