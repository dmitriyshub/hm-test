The find command

The find command searches a designated directory for files that match specific criteria
Can search by: – Owner – File name – File size – File modification date
Can specify which directories to search to narrow the scope
Can specify an action to take when the file is found
Syntax: find [directory to start from][options][what to find] – Example: find /home/student01 -name fileA.txt

The find command searches a directory and any of its subdirectories for files that match specific criteria. Search criteria can include file name, file type, file size, file owner, and file modification date, and you can search by logical expressions. When searching by name, wildcard characters can be used to match based on a character pattern. In addition, you can specify an action to take on matching files, such as delete or run a specified command on them. The find command can also be used with pipe (|) to input the findings into another program.
In the example that is shown, the find command returns all files with a name of fileA.txt in the /home/student01 directory and its subdirectories.
