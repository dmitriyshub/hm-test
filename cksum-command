The cksum command

This command generates a checksum value for a file or stream of data.
It is used to see whether the file was corrupted during transfer.
The cksum command displays a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value and the byte count for a file.
If the file’s CRC value is the same before and after a transfer, the file was not corrupted.
Syntax: cksum [FileName]

The cksum command generates a checksum value for a file or stream of data that the user can use to see whether the file was corrupted during transfer.
Specifically, it computes and displays a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value for the file and shows its size in bytes.
The CRC value is derived from the contents of the file and is used to validate the file’s integrity.
If a file’s checksum value is the same before and after a transfer, the file was not corrupted.
